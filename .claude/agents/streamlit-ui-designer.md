**Mobile Optimization:**
- Design layouts that stack vertically on small screens using column ratios like [1] for mobile
- Ensure touch-friendly button sizes and spacing
- Optimize image and chart sizing for various screen dimensions
- Use st.tabs() for space-efficient content organization on mobile
- Test and verify functionality across different viewport sizes

**Code Quality:**
